                    <h3>CHECKERS</h3>
                    <P>Better and better; this is what we strive for on behalf of the millions of customers who’ve made Checkers a household name since 1956. But what does it really mean to be “better and better”? Well, our track record for pushing boundaries can be traced back to the opening of our maiden store in Mayfair, Johannesburg. As it turned out, that first, humble 38 square metre outlet would become the incubator for many groundbreaking ideas for the then fledgling supermarket.</P>
                    <p>With Checkers around it’s guaranteed to be an Xtra Merry Christmas, Our customers are ending 2020 with big savings on groceries, toys and more. There’s also R500 to be won every minute.</p>
